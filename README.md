I have been fortunate to have worked with some incredible people over the years, and have written and/or contributed many packages and pieces of software, such as: 

  - `hdImpute` ([![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/hdImpute)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hdImpute))
  - `performance` ([![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/performance)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=performance))
  - `insight` ([![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/insight)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=insight))
  - `see` ([![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/see)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=see))
  - `mlbstats` ([![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/mlbstats)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mlbstats))
  - `amerika` ([![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/amerika)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=amerika))
  - `effectsize` ([![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/effectsize)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=effectsize))
  - `plotmm` ([![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/plotmm)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=plotmm))

While I don't work publicly on Github too much these days, I always love meeting new people and hearing about their work. So, if you'd like to chat or collaborate, please feel free to [reach out](https://pdwaggoner.github.io/) directly.
